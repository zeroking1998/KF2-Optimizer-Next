# Changelog

Release notes stay short and user-focused. Every release uses only **What's
new**, **Bug fixes**, and optional **Important notes** so the important changes
are visible immediately.

## 0.0.3-alpha - 2026-08-22

### What's new

- The interface now has four clear areas: Home, Optimization, Overlay, and
  Help & Repair.
- Optimization now exposes only Target FPS and Maximum corpses. Adaptive
  automatically manages verified quality, physics, LOD, FleX, and corpse
  runtime controls.
- Update and Repair are always visible in the upper-right corner. The Update
  button is highlighted when a newer version is available.
- A safe portable updater checks official GitHub Releases automatically at
  most once every 24 hours or manually from the upper-right Update button.
- Available updates show the version, publication date, download size and this
  concise changelog before the user decides whether to install or wait.
- Approved updates verify the official repository, version, Windows-x64 asset
  name, exact size and SHA-256 before installation.

### Bug fixes

- Removed the footer, advanced-settings toggle, manual fine-tuning entry, and
  redundant explanatory text from the normal interface.
- Failed downloads, invalid packages, failed replacement and failed restart
  now leave or restore the previous working application version.
- Updates replace only managed program files and preserve portable settings,
  logs, backups, profiles and other user data.

### Important notes

- Updates are never downloaded or installed without explicit user approval.
- The application remains fully portable; the temporary update helper removes
  itself and its working files after restart.

## 0.0.2-alpha - 2026-08-22

### What's new

- **Auto Repair from GitHub** downloads the Windows package for the exact
  installed version and repairs missing or damaged managed files.
- **Import Local Package** remains available for offline recovery.

### Bug fixes

- Package repair now verifies the build identity and every managed SHA-256
  value before changing files.

### Important notes

- The executable is not code-signed yet, so Windows SmartScreen may warn on
  first launch.

## 0.0.1-alpha - 2026-08-21

### What's new

- Diagnostics can import required files from a complete matching portable
  package.
- Public versions use the `0.0.x-alpha` format.

### Bug fixes

- Local repair rejects mismatched builds and unsafe package files.

## 0.1.0-beta.2 - 2026-08-21

### Bug fixes

- Complete portable packages now start normally instead of incorrectly
  entering Safe Mode.
- Release validation now fails when a package rejects its own integrity
  manifest.

## 0.1.0-beta.1 - 2026-08-21

### What's new

- Added English documentation, GPL-3.0-only licensing, contribution templates,
  Windows CI and the ready-to-run portable package.
- Added actor-correlated corpse physics evidence and variable 30–240 FPS
  targets.

### Bug fixes

- Telemetry world tracking no longer keeps a completed world alive.
- Corpse and FleX reporting no longer presents unconfirmed requests as applied.
- Packaging now continues correctly after building a missing telemetry module.
